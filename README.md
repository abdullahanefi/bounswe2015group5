# Xplore: Connecting the dots #



## Project Description: ##

The Web is full of information. When we want to find and make use of this information we are confronted with the issue of finding the relevant information in a meaningful context. Bits and pieces are spread across the web and we need to find the correct pieces and put them together. This becomes even more challenging when we are faced with information that is unfolding at a fast pace -- that is often the case.

This is a crowdsourcing application that aims to harness the power and wisdom of the crowds in order to gather material that is spread across the web for specific contexts. This will involve finding and referencing information as well as tracking how it updates. It should specifically address public content, such as Twitter public feed, blogs, web sites and so on.

Any topic that becomes interesting flourishes and branches in many different and related topics. The central theme remains. It is difficult to pull together information that is contributed by many people in several in an incremental manner. Yet, it is very valuable. This project aims to provide a space of cooperative contribution in a meaningful manner.

This is a social semantic project. It is social since the content is related and/or created by people. This application aims to organize the content in a meaningful (semantic) of better understanding.

With such applications users can explore any theme from multiple aspects for a much wider and deeper perspective based on the interest and knowledge of the contributors.

An interesting case to examine is the fury of information that is contributed regarding a murder case from 1999. This case got attention after a 12 series podcast in the Fall of 2014 (serialpodcast by Serial). This case brought into light the US criminal system, forensic evidence, nature of memory, evidence, racial issues (as both the victim and the prosecuted individuals were from immigrant roots), and many more topics.

Users will be able to contribute information, ask questions, answer questions, rate contributions in terms of accuracy, emotional reaction, clarity, etc. They will be able to semantically tag content. They will be able to summarize and relate content.

People, locations, and concepts are particularly important to get your mind around topics. So, they must be specially visible when presented.

The system will provide recommendations of content within a specific topic or other similar topics.

This application will have an android based web client as well as web client. In the future other mobile clients are planned. An API should be developed to interface with the server.
